Here is a list of details/observations relevant to his correct usage, you can see this as a sort of "list of known issues" 

- Spaces you want to be loaded as Empty must be painted black
 
- Will add in teh future some tutorial to add some others tilesets, tiles and such, be aware tho, they need to have the same size than all the others tilesets in the code otherwise it will show with a different size.
 
- The click receiver to change a tile of type works fine but is kinda wonky, so you want to have the clearer angle possible before pressing a tile in order to the editor not to confuse the tile you are pressing on

- Suggestions or bug reports: open an issue or contact me in the relevant discord.

- The movement inside the map editor is like the standard camera movement of stride3d, i'm open to change it if and when i have a better proposal about to which shape to change it.

- The save files are inside the folder "Worlds", the file will have the name you gave the world when you create it, otherwise will have a standard name but in this context that standarized name should never happend.

- It's GLP-3, so feel free to make wherever modification you want, fork it or otherwise.

- Try to get backups of the maps in the folder "World", otherwise you could accidentally overwritten the old version if by any means one world have the same name than the one you are working on when you save, so be carefull with that. 

(yes, i haven't add a windows to search for files or otherwise, i didn't consider a priority for now because i'm trying to invest time in the game itself)

Thats it for now, i will add more info to this list when relevant

Have a nice day!
